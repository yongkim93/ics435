along in the process and get you started with a site of your own The next step in the process is to select a hosting provider and pick a great domain name for your site This is one of my favorite parts when launching a new site or blogStep nbspSelecting Your Domain Name and Blog HostingWith WordPress being selected as our blogging platform its now time to set up the other two most important factors to getting your blog liveA Domain Name This is the address you type in whenever you want to visit a site wwwnamecomA Hosting Provider This is the service that places your site content on the internet for others to seeAgain even if you never created a website or blog before dont worry The process of setting these up is extremely simple and once its done you wont need to mess around with any of these settings againHow to Get a Free Domain NameAnyone can register a domain name The toughest part is simply coming up with an original name that isnt already registered yet On average domain names will cost around per year to register However I was able to get an amazing promotion from my recommended web host Bluehostcom where they will give you a free domain name if you set up a web hosting plan today Not only do I recommend Bluehost WordPress recommends them as wellIn addition to a free domain namenbspwhen you setup your hosting with Bluehost you will also receive premium hosting for just pennies per day This will also allow you to setup a unique email account for your site as well such as nameyourblognamecom which is a lot more professional than a free Yahoo Hotmail or Gmail account Its all very easy to setup once setup with BluehostHow to Pick a Great Domain NameWith all of that in mind here are a few tips on how to pick a great domain name for your blogKeep it short and simple Stay away from numbers and dashes Pick a name that isnbspeasy to spell and memorable Dont use any copyright or trademarked names Use keywords that are relevant to your topic Stick with a com net or org domain extension If its available always try to register YourNamecomThousands of domain names are registered every day so if you keep finding that your requested domain name is already taken dont get discouraged If you cant think of anything unique I always recommend seeing if your personal name is available as a domain This is always good to try and register as it likely wont be available foreverWhich extension should you pick for your domain nameAlso when choosing a domain name you will have a few different options as for the type of domain extension you want to use The com is always going to be the most popular followed by net and then org However there are many other extensions to choose from though I recommend you stick with any of the three mentioned here

doing anything for the first time we all have questions To help with this process I wanted to provide you with some of the most frequent questions I get asked on a daily basisHow can I get more visitors to my blogDid you know that there are currently over a billion active websites and blogs on the internet today Its true and while there are plenty of people already on the internet that is still a lot of websites and content to compete against When launching a new website or blog traffic and visitors to your site might be a bit slow However as you continue to come out with new content on your site rank in the search results and share content with your friends traffic to your site will continue to grow over time If you want to implement some actionable methods to start increasing traffic to your site today get started with these free traffic generation methodsWhen will my site start showing in GoogleGoogle will automatically find your website or blog once its been around for a few days and has some content published and people visiting your site A great way to speed up this process is to link to your blog from your social profile or anywhere else that might be relevant Keep in mind just because your site has been indexed by Google that doesnt mean it will necessarily start ranking high in the search results or for generic keywords that you think it should The process of ranking a site in Google is quite complex I recommend you read through these simple SEO tips for beginners to have a better understanding of how this process worksHow can I make money with my blogThe ultimate goal for many bloggers is to eventually make money with their site and content Fortunately this is something Ive had a lot of experience with So much so that I actually wrote a complete guide on how to make money blogging Not only does it break down the process of how to choose a niche market or different monetization methods to use I also show you real examples of how this is being done today If you want to find financial success with blogging its all about providing value to your audience Billions of people are using Google and visiting sites on a daily basis to find solutions to their problems If your website or blog can help solve those problems there is a good chance you can start making some money in the processIm not sure if I want to blog yet Should I start with a free blog like WordPressorg Blogger or BlogspotThis is one of the most asked questions that I get when it comes to starting a blog and the answer is definitely no If you are going to put in the time and effort to start a web site or blog you might as well start off in the right direction from day one Many people like to start a free blog through solutions like Blogspot but this is actually more of a waste of time and effort than anything else This is something I cover in my articles on why you should never choose a free hosting provider To answer the question as quickly and efficiently as possible anyone who uses a free blogging platform will likely not have complete ownership over their content along with also being limited on if they can have a domain name what site themes they can use and even if they can make money with their site Start off in the right direction by investing a few dollars into premium hostingWhat if Im not good at writing or am a horrible spellerBlogging is unlike any other form of content creation weve ever seen There are no requirements or skills needs to start a blog of your own and it doesnt matter what level of education or expertise in any given niche you have To tell you the truth Ive never been a huge fan of writing or reading but ever since I started my blog in Ive now published over articles online and have become a very faster and talented writer in the process In fact if improving your writing skills is something you would like to work on having a blog is a great way to accomplish this So to answer the question no you dont need to be a great writer to start a blog after all its your own little spot on the internet and you can do whatever you like with it There are also plenty of free and premium tools like Grammarly that can act as a spell checker as you write and create content for your site This is one of my favorite blogging tools and one that I use on a daily basisWhat if I already have a domain but still need hostingThis is something that will happen to a lot of people They will first register a domain name then not complete their blog and never get set up with web hosting either If this is what happened to you no worries I recommend you create an account with Bluehost and simply transfer your domain or DNS to their site This will be free and easy to set up once you have a hosting account Also all new customers to Bluehost will also receive a free domain name at the time of sign up so dont miss out on that great opportunity as well There is no limit to the number of domains you can own or useCan I get famous from starting a blogOften times we will see everyday people become overnight success stories through the use of websites social media YouTube and even blogs The first thing to note is that most of these overnight success stories arent really overnight and have a lot of blood sweat and tears behind them Take Perez Hilton for example he got started with a celebrity gossip blog and look how rich famous and successful he is today In short you can definitely get famous or become an industry leader within your market through the use of a blog Depending on what you are trying to accomplish with your site a lot of things can happen For instance I was featured on Fox News and ABC News as a blogging expert and have been able to teach thousands of people how to get started with a blog of their own No matter what it is you are trying to accomplish with a blog if you put in the time and effort to make it great you can definitely become famous successful and even wealthy in the processWhat are some other types of blogs I can createWhen it comes to blogging there is no right or wrong approach The most important thing is that you choose a topic you are
